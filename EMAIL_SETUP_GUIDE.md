# üìß Email Contact Form Setup Guide

Your contact form is now ready to send real emails! You have two options to choose from:

## üéØ Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended)

EmailJS allows you to send emails directly from your frontend without a backend server.

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account

1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account (allows 200 emails/month)

### Step 2: Add Email Service

1. Go to **Email Services** in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Click **Add New Service**
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the instructions to connect your email account

### Step 3: Create Email Template

1. Go to **Email Templates** in your dashboard
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Use this template structure:

```html
Subject: New Portfolio Contact: {{from_name}} From: {{from_name}}
({{from_email}}) To: {{to_name}} Message: {{message}} --- This email was sent
from your portfolio contact form.
```

### Step 4: Get Your Credentials

1. **Service ID**: Found in Email Services section
2. **Template ID**: Found in Email Templates section
3. **Public Key**: Found in Account > API Keys

### Step 5: Update Configuration

Edit `/src/config/emailConfig.js` and replace:

```javascript
export const emailConfig = {
  serviceId: "your_actual_service_id",
  templateId: "your_actual_template_id",
  publicKey: "your_actual_public_key",
};
```

## üöÄ Option 2: Formspree (Simpler Setup)

Formspree is easier to set up and doesn't require API keys.

### Step 1: Create Formspree Account

1. Go to [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)
2. Sign up for a free account (allows 50 submissions/month)

### Step 2: Create New Form

1. Click **+ New Form** in your dashboard
2. Give it a name like "Portfolio Contact"
3. Set the email where you want to receive messages

### Step 3: Get Form URL

1. Copy your form's endpoint URL
2. It will look like: `https://formspree.io/f/xvgpkjqw`

### Step 4: Update Configuration

Edit `/src/config/emailConfig.js` and replace:

```javascript
export const formspreeConfig = {
  actionUrl: "https://formspree.io/f/your_actual_form_id",
};
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

1. **Start your development server**: `npm start`
2. **Navigate to the Contact section**
3. **Fill out the form and submit**
4. **Check your email inbox** for the message

If you see a warning message, it means the configuration isn't set up yet.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### EmailJS Issues:

- Make sure your service is activated
- Check that your template variables match
- Verify your public key is correct
- Check browser console for errors

### Formspree Issues:

- Verify your form URL is correct
- Make sure your form is not in draft mode
- Check that you've confirmed your email address

### Both Options:

- Check your spam folder
- Verify the form data is being submitted
- Look at browser network tab for failed requests

## üí° Recommendation

**For beginners**: Use Formspree - it's simpler and works immediately.
**For advanced users**: Use EmailJS - it gives you more control and customization options.

You can even keep both configured as backup options (the code will try EmailJS first, then fall back to Formspree if needed).

## üì¨ Current Status

Your contact form will show appropriate messages:

- ‚úÖ **Success**: Message sent successfully
- ‚ùå **Error**: Something went wrong
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Setup Needed**: Service not configured yet

Once you configure either service, the contact form will start sending real emails to your inbox!
